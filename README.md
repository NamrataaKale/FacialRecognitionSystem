__Facial Recognition System__

__Project Overview__

This project implements a facial recognition system using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Eigenvalues to accurately recognize and classify human faces. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, while ANN is employed for classification tasks. Eigenvalues help in the process of extracting meaningful features from face images.

__Features__

PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is used to reduce the complexity of face images and extract the most important features (Eigenfaces).

ANN for Classification: An artificial neural network is used to classify the extracted features and recognize faces.

Eigenvalue-based Face Representation: Eigenvalues are used to determine the significance of the features and build an efficient face recognition model.

Real-time Face Recognition: The system is capable of recognizing faces from images and videos in real-time.


__Requirements__

Python 3.x

NumPy

OpenCV

TensorFlow/Keras (for ANN)

Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

__Results__

Accuracy: The system provides an accuracy of over 90% for the face recognition task based on the dataset used.

Real-time performance: The model performs efficiently on both still images and live video feeds.
